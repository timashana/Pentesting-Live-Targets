# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets
Penetration testing 3 different websites for the Codepath cybersecurity class
 
Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQLi: "Find Salesperson" page is vulnerable to SQL Injection
-If 'OR SLEEP(5)=0--' is URL-encoded and inserted as the value for id at the end of the page address, there is a noticeable delay and the first salesman's (id=1) page is returned:
